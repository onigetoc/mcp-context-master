# Context Master MCP Server - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

The user reported that their MCP Context Master server was not working correctly when used with Roo Code. The specific issue was:

- User asked for "Remotion captions" documentation
- The LLM incorrectly tried to use `add_project_context` with "@remotion/captions" (which doesn't exist)
- The tool should have guided the user to search for "Remotion" first, then use Context7 with topic "captions"

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Search-First Workflow**: The MCP server lacked clear guidance for when to search vs. when to add context directly
2. **Poor Tool Descriptions**: Tool descriptions didn't clearly explain the difference between exact package names and search queries
3. **No Search Advisor**: Users had no way to discover the correct library names before adding context
4. **Inadequate Agent Instructions**: The AGENTS.md file lacked specific workflow guidance for Context Master

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Agent Instructions Template
- **File**: `templates/agent-prompt.md`
- **Purpose**: Standardized instructions for AI assistants on how to use Context Master
- **Key Features**:
  - Clear workflow examples (✅ Correct vs ❌ Wrong)
  - Explains when to use GitHub search vs npm search
  - Provides Context7 integration guidance

### 2. Updated AGENTS.md
- **Added**: Complete Context Master instructions section
- **Includes**: Tool descriptions, workflow examples, best practices
- **Format**: Structured for easy AI assistant consumption

### 3. Created Search Advisor Tool
- **File**: `src/tools/search-advisor.tool.ts`
- **Purpose**: Help users find correct library names and get workflow guidance
- **Features**:
  - Searches GitHub for libraries
  - Provides Context7 URLs with topics
  - Gives clear next-step instructions
  - Handles search failures gracefully

### 4. Improved Tool Descriptions
- **Updated**: `add_project_context` tool description
- **Clarified**: When to use exact names vs. search first
- **Added**: Examples of correct vs. incorrect usage

### 5. Enhanced Command System
- **Updated**: Command dispatcher and command reference files
- **Added**: Search advisor to available commands
- **Improved**: Workflow documentation

## Technical Implementation

### New Tool: `search_library_advisor`
```typescript
// Usage example:
{
  "name": "search_library_advisor",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "Remotion",
    "topic": "captions"
  }
}
```

**Output provides**:
- Correct repository name (remotion-dev/remotion)
- Context7 URL with topic
- Step-by-step workflow guidance
- Alternative approaches

### Updated Tool Registry
- Added search advisor to `src/tools/index.ts`
- Registered handler in tool handlers
- Updated build process

### Workflow Examples

#### Before (❌ Wrong):
```
User: "Add Remotion captions context"
LLM: add_project_context("@remotion/captions") // Fails - doesn't exist
```

#### After (✅ Correct):
```
User: "Add Remotion captions context"
LLM: 
1. search_library_advisor("Remotion", "captions")
2. Get guidance: use "remotion-dev/remotion" with topic "captions"
3. resolve_library_id("Remotion") // External Context7 MCP
4. get_library_docs(resolved_id, topic="captions") // External Context7 MCP
```

## Testing Results

Created `test/test-search-advisor.js` and verified:
- ✅ Remotion search works correctly
- ✅ Provides proper Context7 URLs with topics
- ✅ Handles non-existent libraries gracefully
- ⚠️ React Query search needs improvement (found tRPC instead of TanStack)

## Integration Points

### With External Context7 MCP
- Search advisor provides correct library IDs for Context7
- Generates proper Context7 URLs with topics
- Guides users to external MCP tools when available

### With AI Assistants
- Clear instructions in AGENTS.md
- Structured workflow examples
- Error handling guidance

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `templates/agent-prompt.md` - Agent instruction template
- `src/tools/search-advisor.tool.ts` - New search advisor tool
- `test/test-search-advisor.js` - Test for new functionality
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files:
- `AGENTS.md` - Added Context Master instructions
- `src/tools/add_context.tool.ts` - Improved tool description
- `src/tools/index.ts` - Added new tool to registry
- `templates/agent-prompt.md` - Updated workflow examples

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Search Algorithm**: Fix React Query → TanStack Query mapping
2. **Add More Examples**: Create more workflow examples for common libraries
3. **Test Integration**: Test with actual Roo Code or other AI assistants
4. **Documentation**: Update README with new workflow guidance
5. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery suggestions

## Usage Example

Now when a user asks for library documentation, the AI assistant should:

1. Use `search_library_advisor` to find the correct library
2. Follow the provided workflow guidance
3. Use external Context7 MCP tools for best results
4. Fall back to internal tools if needed

This creates a much more robust and user-friendly experience for Context Master.
