# PRP Integration Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**
Integration with the popular PRP (Project Requirements Prompt) methodology that reached 8k stars. Our system will automatically fork, fill, and enhance PRP templates.

## ðŸ”— **PRP Template Enhancement**

### **Original PRP Workflow (Manual)**
```
1. User manually clones PRP repository
2. User fills out template sections by hand
3. User researches and adds technical details
4. User creates project structure manually
5. User searches for documentation and context
```

### **Our Enhanced Workflow (Automated)**
```
1. User provides basic prompt: "Build a SaaS dashboard"
2. System automatically:
   - Forks PRP template
   - Analyzes prompt for project requirements
   - Fills all template sections intelligently
   - Downloads relevant technical context
   - Sets up project structure
   - Creates ready-to-code environment
```

## ðŸ¤– **Automatic Template Filling**

### **Prompt Analysis Engine**
```yaml
Input: "Build a SaaS dashboard for project management"

Analysis:
  project_type: "web_application"
  domain: "project_management"
  architecture: "saas"
  complexity: "medium-high"
  
Auto-Generated Sections:
  project_name: "ProjectFlow Dashboard"
  description: "A comprehensive SaaS solution for project management with real-time collaboration, task tracking, and analytics."
  
  target_users:
    - "Project managers in small to medium companies"
    - "Development teams needing task coordination"
    - "Freelancers managing multiple client projects"
  
  core_features:
    - "Real-time task management"
    - "Team collaboration tools"
    - "Project analytics and reporting"
    - "Time tracking and billing"
    - "Client portal access"
```

### **Technical Stack Auto-Selection**
```yaml
Based on: "SaaS dashboard for project management"

Recommended Stack:
  frontend:
    framework: "Next.js 14"
    styling: "Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui"
    state: "Zustand"
    reason: "Modern, scalable, great DX for dashboards"
  
  backend:
    runtime: "Node.js"
    framework: "tRPC + Prisma"
    database: "PostgreSQL"
    auth: "NextAuth.js"
    reason: "Type-safe, rapid development, enterprise-ready"
  
  infrastructure:
    hosting: "Vercel"
    database: "PlanetScale"
    storage: "AWS S3"
    monitoring: "Sentry"
    reason: "Scalable, cost-effective for SaaS"

Context Downloads Triggered:
  - next.js-dashboard-patterns-context.md
  - trpc-api-design-context.md
  - prisma-saas-schema-context.md
  - tailwind-dashboard-components-context.md
  - nextauth-saas-setup-context.md
```

```bash
# Automated by our system
git clone https://github.com/original-prp-repo/template
cd template
# Apply our enhancements
# Fill templates automatically
# Download context documentation
# Initialize project structure
```

### **Phase 2: Template Enhancement**

2. Choose technology stack (1-2 hours)
3. Set up development environment (1-3 hours)
4. Find and read documentation (2-6 hours)
5. Start coding (finally!)

Our Approach:
1. Describe what you want to build (30 seconds)
2. Start coding (immediately!)
```
