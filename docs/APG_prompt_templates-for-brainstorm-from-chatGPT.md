# ðŸ§© Advanced Prompt Generator (APG) â€“ Prompt Chain Templates

## 1. Trame GÃ©nÃ©rique avec Placeholders

```
A prompt chain is a structured sequence of interconnected prompts designed to guide an AI through a complex task step-by-step. 

The overall goal is: {goal}.

The process begins broadly by {exploration_stage}, then progressively narrows down toward {refinement_stage}, and finally concludes with {final_stage}. 

The chain adapts to different contexts, such as {domain_examples}, while leaving flexibility for the AI to fill in missing details from the userâ€™s context. 

Constraints or preferences to keep in mind: {constraints}.

### 2.1 Brainstorming Produit
```
A prompt chain is a structured sequence of interconnected prompts designed to guide an AI through a complex task step-by-step. 

The overall goal is: brainstorm innovative product ideas. 

The process begins broadly by exploring creative possibilities and diverse use cases, then progressively narrows down toward identifying real-world pain points and market fit, and finally concludes with an actionable roadmap for the most promising idea. 

The chain adapts to different contexts, such as product design, software development, or market research, while leaving flexibility for the AI to fill in missing details from the userâ€™s context. 

Constraints or preferences to keep in mind: focus on scalable solutions with high innovation potential.

### 2.2 Analyse StratÃ©gique
```
A prompt chain is a structured sequence of interconnected prompts designed to guide an AI through a complex task step-by-step. 

The overall goal is: analyze a specific market or industry. 

The process begins broadly by gathering general information and mapping key players, then progressively narrows down toward identifying opportunities, risks, and trends, and finally concludes with a clear set of recommendations or a strategic plan. 

The chain adapts to different contexts, such as competitive analysis, financial assessment, or consumer behavior studies, while leaving flexibility for the AI to fill in missing details from the userâ€™s context. 

Constraints or preferences to keep in mind: emphasize reliability, data-driven insights, and clarity.

### 2.3 RÃ©daction CrÃ©ative
```
A prompt chain is a structured sequence of interconnected prompts designed to guide an AI through a complex task step-by-step. 

The overall goal is: generate a compelling piece of creative writing. 

The process begins broadly by exploring themes, moods, and character archetypes, then progressively narrows down toward plot development, dialogue, and structure, and finally concludes with a polished draft ready for review. 

The chain adapts to different contexts, such as short stories, novels, poetry, or scripts, while leaving flexibility for the AI to fill in missing details from the userâ€™s context. 

Constraints or preferences to keep in mind: respect tone, style, and audience expectations.

### 2.4 DÃ©veloppement Logiciel
```
A prompt chain is a structured sequence of interconnected prompts designed to guide an AI through a complex task step-by-step. 

The overall goal is: design and implement a software solution. 

The process begins broadly by understanding requirements and possible approaches, then progressively narrows down toward defining architecture, features, and implementation details, and finally concludes with example code or a technical specification. 

The chain adapts to different contexts, such as web development, data engineering, or AI/ML, while leaving flexibility for the AI to fill in missing details from the userâ€™s context. 

Constraints or preferences to keep in mind: use modern best practices, ensure scalability, and follow clean code standards.
